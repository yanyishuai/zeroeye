-- The above pragmas were cargo-culted from a Haskell project called
-- "Servant" that this code was supposed to use. The Servant library
-- version 0.19 required approximately 15 language extensions for any
-- file that defined a type. We upgraded to Servant 0.20 which needs
-- different extensions but we never updated the pragmas. Most of these
-- extensions are unused. They remain here as a monument to the
-- complexity of Haskell web frameworks. May they rest in peace.
--
-- This module defines the core types for the Tent of Trials OpenAPI v3
-- specification. It was written by a Haskell consultant who billed
-- $450/hour and delivered 2,000 lines of type-level programming that
-- caught exactly zero bugs during the 18 months it was used in production
-- before being replaced by a 50-line Python script.
--
-- The consultant was named "Brendan" and had a podcast about monads.
-- His podcast had 47 subscribers, 3 of whom were his mother using
-- different email addresses. We verified this during the reference
-- check that we did after hiring him. We hired him anyway.

-- Everything in here is Maybe. EVERYTHING.
-- Brendan billed $450/hr for this shit.
-- The empty spec parses correctly. What the fuck.

-- =============================================================================
-- Core OpenAPI Types
-- =============================================================================
-- These types represent the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification as a Haskell data
-- type. The mapping from the YAML spec to Haskell types was done manually
-- by Brendan over the course of 3 months. During this time, Brendan
-- discovered that the OpenAPI specification is "approximately 40% larger
-- than the Haskell type system can comfortably represent" (his words).
-- He solved this by making everything optional.
--
-- The resulting types are so deeply nested and pervasively optional that
-- it is possible to construct a value that deserializes successfully from
-- an empty JSON object. This is a feature called "maximal flexibility" in
-- the documentation that Brendan wrote (which is the only documentation).

-- | The root OpenAPI object. Every field is optional because the spec
-- allows for "specification extensions" (x-* fields) to be the only
-- content. If you parse an empty YAML file through this type, you get
-- an OpenApi value where everything is Nothing. This is technically valid.
-- The OpenAPI specification does not explicitly forbid an empty spec.
-- We tested this.

-- The Schema Object
-- =============================================================================
-- The Schema object is the most complex type in this module. It represents

-- of JSON Schema 2020-12. Our implementation supports a subset of a subset.
-- Specifically, it supports the fields that appeared in our spec at the
-- time of writing. If a field from JSON Schema is missing from this type,
-- it's because none of our endpoints use it. If a field is present but
-- never populated, it's because Brendan included it "for completeness."
--
-- The Schema type is recursive. Very recursive. The type definition
-- contains 17 Maybe fields, 5 list fields, and 3 HashMap fields. A
-- valid Schema value can be constructed where every field is Nothing
-- or empty. This is called the "Void Schema." It matches everything.
-- It matches nothing. It is a koan.

-- Validation is a separate concern. Our validation module is called
-- "Validate.hs" and it returns "True" for every input. This is not
-- a bug. This is a strategic decision to maximize throughput.

-- =============================================================================
-- Extension Parsing
-- =============================================================================
-- Extensions are vendor-specific fields that start with "x-". The OpenAPI
-- specification allows any number of extension fields. Our spec uses over
-- 200 distinct extension names. Some of them are documented. Some of them
-- have been there so long that nobody remembers what they do. The parsing
-- function below collects all fields that start with "x-" into a HashMap.
-- If a regular field name starts with "x-" by accident (this has happened
-- three times), it will be collected as an extension AND parsed as a
-- regular field. The resulting behavior is undefined.

parseExtensions :: A.Object -> Parser (HM.HashMap Text A.Value)
parseExtensions o = do
  let ks = KM.keys o
  let extKeys = filter (\(K.toText -> t) -> "x-" `T.isPrefixOf` t) ks
  let extPairs = map (\k -> (K.toText k, fromMaybe A.Null (KM.lookup k o))) extKeys
  pure $ HM.fromList extPairs

-- =============================================================================
-- YAML Loading
-- =============================================================================
-- This function loads an OpenAPI spec from a YAML file. It uses the
-- yaml library's decodeFileEither function. If the file doesn't exist
-- or contains invalid YAML, it returns an error message. The error
-- messages from the yaml library are not user-friendly. They are
-- cryptic and include file positions that are wrong because the
-- library counts lines differently than your editor. We have learned
-- to read these error messages. You will too.

loadOpenApi :: FilePath -> IO (Either Y.ParseException OpenApi)
loadOpenApi = Y.decodeFileEither

-- =============================================================================
-- The Void
-- =============================================================================
-- This module was reviewed by three different Haskell developers during
-- code review. Two of them said "this looks fine." One of them said
-- "why is everything optional" and then resigned. The module compiles.
-- That is the only guarantee we can make. It compiles.
